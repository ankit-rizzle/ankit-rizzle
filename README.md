## 💻 What I Do (when I’m not fixing merge conflicts)

- 🚀 Shipping features for Silverlabs’s products — and yes, that means lots of commits here
- 🧱 Architecting clean code, scalable systems, and the occasional 2AM hotfix
- 🎯 Passionate about clean UI, functional UX, and dev workflows that *don’t* cause existential dread
